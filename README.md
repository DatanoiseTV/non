This branch was created originally to optimize graphics drawing in Non Sequencer and has since become more general in scope to also include bug fixes and functional improvements.

About Non
===
Non reinvents the DAW.  Powerful enough to form a complete studio, fast and light enough to run on low-end hardware like the eeePC or Raspberry Pi, and so reliable that it can be used live, the Non DAW Studio is a modular system composed of four main parts: Non Timeline, a non-destructive, non-linear audio recorder and arranger. Non Mixer, a live mixer with effects plugin hosting and advanced Ambisonics spatialization control. Non Sequencer, a live, pattern based MIDI sequencer, and finally, the Non Session Manager to tie together these applications and more into cohesive song-level units.


Documentation
===
Here you will find some Non Sequencer user interface documentation, which is evolving as I figure out how to use it.  Also, this branch is currently exploring some fairly drastic user interface changes from the main Non branch.  This documentation is meant to reflect these changes.
